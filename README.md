# CopyPaste

_CopyPaste_ is an Android app that can interact with _V2S_, a screen recording parser, to perform actions on behalf of a user on-device based on the parsed sequence of actions.

It uses the Android Accessibility Service to perform actions for the user, e.g. taps, long-taps and swipes, based on the parsed actions.

This app was created as part of a research project for coursework. The outputs include this app (source code), the research paper, and the presentation (linked below).
